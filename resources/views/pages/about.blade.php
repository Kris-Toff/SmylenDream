                Siquijor “Dream Team”  are so happy to have a dedicated team consisting of relatives and friends and we’re as happy to have them as they are to work for us. Some of the workers have been with us since June 2011 when we started our house in Lumangcapan. Mylen’s father, Andres Cento has been a building contractor his whole life and even now at almost 80 years old, he doesn’t want to stop working. It’s nice to have him around to keep an eye on things. He really knows how to get things done. Since Mylen and I are not always around, it’s good that they don’t really need supervision, but just in case, Mylen’s cousin and Best Friend, Neneng is there to fill in and keep an eye on things. She and Mylen could easily be real estate brokers, simply with what they learned while purchasing the few properties that we now own. Sometimes, Trial and Error will teach you all that you need to learn. One of the very best things is the range of expertise which we have. We have expert masons, painters, gardeners and all around handymen and women. When I asked Mr. Boyet, a Chinese/Filipino businessman if I could rent his bulldozer to help dig out our drive way, he gave me some numbers, which were kind of high, but then said; “Do you know how many men with shovels and picks who you could hire for the amount it would cost to rent my “doser”? That made a lot of sense to us since we’re trying to help as many of our people as possible. So a recently laid off worker who was our across the street neighbor was hired simply to clear out our drive way. It took him a long time, but he did such a great job, and also helped out the other workers, that he’s been with us every since. He also can do almost anything now since the older, more experienced guys love teaching the kids. We also started out to build a very simple bamboo Nippa hut, but when all the cost were analyzed, it actually cost less to use “hollow” blocks and we eventually started making them ourselves to make sure we got the top quality. Here’s some more of the team!
